Description of a workflow involving Git and Debian Packaging Tools (dpkg-dev)
=============================================================================


1. Create software in git repository
2. When a version is ready to release create a version tag vX.Y.Z
3. Create a new git branch from the tag snapshot caling it something like vX.Y.Z.deb
4. Create a folder name following the form: <package>-<version>
5. Move all source files into this folder
6. In this folder run 'dh_make --indep --createorig' and confirm details.
7. Change dir to ./debian and correct details from step 6.


The dh_make command will create a folder 'debian' complete with examples and templates to help you integrate your package into the running of your system. 
These include: manpages, runlevel initialisation, registration as cron-job, pre- and post-install/remove scripts, creation of an entry in the system menu.
